Dear Madam,
With due respect, I am a student of SWE231 Software Engineering Project-1,  3 credit course under the department of Software Engineering, are submitting the project documentation on the project named “Hospital Management System”. The report is prepared based on the system requirements analysis and designing of the software as well as the testing of the project.
This document has enabled us to gain the insight into the core facts of creating software with the help of your guideline.
I have tried my best to follow and implement the experience learnt of software engineering in this project. I hope that the project will meet the expectation of the users. 


Sincerely Yours,

Abstract:

2 part have in our system (Admin/Manager & Reception staff)
At first need to registration (unit user) this system then log in system. If any way forget (Admin / Manager) user name or password then anytime forget her registration. Registration time need this all information for user (User name, password, Email, Phone number, Gender). Admin add new Doctor & Staff in this system and admin change this information in the system (Update doctor information, Search any Doctor information, Delete any Doctor Information, Add new staff, Update staff Information, Search any staff Information, Delete any staff information (Doctor & staff Id is a main element in this system) ). Admin search any patient information from file (using patient Id) but don’t change any patient information this system. Only reception staff can change patient information.

Reception staff can any new patient in this system and reception staff change this information in the system (Update patient Information, search any patient information, Delete any patient Information (using patient id). Reception staff search any doctor Information from File (using doctor id) but don’t change any information in doctor. Only admin can change Doctor & staff information.
This system is a dynamic system. Same time we add, edit, search, delete any information from file. Patient, staff, & doctor all information save all time in this system. Admin see all information any time this system & admin can see reception staff registration information.
This system help to user to maintain her hospital.
